>“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”—Henry Ford

We the people are being subjected to the biggest economic ruse in history. The Federal Government Debt. When it comes to matters of the economy…the DEBT dominates the debate. The government is broke. They spend reckless, we are not thinking about the children, and so on. I am here to tell you that it’s bullshit, and if you believe it, you’ve been had. Do not fret though as most of us fall for this ongoing misinformation. How could we not? It’s been the running economic commentary for the last 35 years. There is a fucking ‘debt’ clock in New York City for God’s sake.

Currently the ‘debt’ is about _$18.4 trillion_, and rising by the mille-second. Each of our shares is about $57k. The [US Debt clock](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) makes all this nonsense from and center. You will arrive at a site displaying large numbers. All kinds of presumably Macro-economic indicators of a perilous nature are on display. Trade deficits, Student Debt figures, Medicare/Medicaid expenditures, Credit Card Debt…you get the idea. Bad news all around—the country is going broke. Is it though?

__Can the US government run out of it’s own money?__ The answer is __NO__. It cannot.

### Big Scary Numbers
We humans are not good at [comprehending large numbers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/16/large-numbers-dehumanising-so-should-big-data-worry-us) by themselves. We need context in order to understand these huge figures. The most effective ‘debt’ narrative has to be comparing the Federal Budget to a household budget. It’s brilliant for many reasons. It’s simple, and every responsible person has a household budget, which makes it relatable. If you use the credit card too much…you got to pay up sometime, plus interest. Unless you raise revenue (your income) you are going to have to make spending cuts. Got to cut the extra stuff. Get down to the necessities. Stop being reckless and irresponsible.

What is an irresponsible debt ridden government to do? Raise revenue? Raise taxes? Aren’t we already taxed enough? We got to cut spending…it’s the adult thing to do. This is one half of the conservative macro-economic solution—the other being cutting taxes (more on that lunacy in a later post). Frighten you with big numbers into accepting their narrative. It has been pretty effective, but with devastating results for our nation.

The idea of the Federal deficit is left over from our commodity backed currency days. When the Government operated on the Gold Standard, its budget was more restricted and based on the ability to convert currency to a commodity, gold. This limited federal spending into the economy. This reality doesn’t exist anymore and has not for a while. The Nixon Administration abolished the remnants of the Gold Standard in 1971. Our current monetary system is that of [fiat money](http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2013/01/08/all-money-is-fiat-money/#278cd2b361e5). Government issued Fiat money has helped us win three of the most important wars in our history. The Revolution, Civil War and World War II.

### Screw You Debt Money & The Banks You Rode in On!
The history of our country is basically a power struggle between the rich and the rest. The banking system is Exhibit Number One in that on-going conflict.

In the 18th Century, the colonial government issued its own debt-free currency and became prosperous independent of the Crown and Bank of England. Upon Ben Franklin’s visit to England he observed it was awash in poverty. He explained the colonial system of Colonial Scrip to his English hosts as the policy behind their prosperity and low poverty. Once word of this got to Parliament they immediately legislated laws undermining this system. Requiring taxes be paid in Gold and Silver. This act became one of the drivers of the Revolution.

In the 19th Century, Abraham Lincoln faced with a increasingly expensive war effort, needed money to win it and save the Union. Interest rates offered by banks to the Government were outrageous, and Lincoln turned to the Constitution for a solution. He used the power of the Federal Government to issue currency to fund the war effort. These notes were backed by the _Full Faith and Credit of the United States_ as Legal Tender. This move helped the Union win without having to pay any interest to any third party. It also led to a expansionary period fueled by innovation and affordable higher education.

In the 20th Century FDR used the power of the federal government to get people back to work and fight WWII which brought us out of the Great Depression. The New Deal swung power in the direction of working people, by expanding the Federal Governments positive role in the economy. Using ‘deficit spending’, FDR created many programs for people who needed work, setting in motion the post-war boom. Not surprising Conservatives of both parties at the time joined together to fight this agenda, and the similar actions taken in the previous centuries.

### Our Economy Remains Stifled
Today, Republicans using the ‘debt’ as their bludgeon have picked up this fight. They continue to say the Federal Debt is our most pressing economic issue. Never mind 40 years of stagnant wages, a crumbling infrastructure, and the gutting of education, which is result of this archaic thinking. We are preventing shared prosperity in the US because of this false narrative in economics spread by politicians and their media.

Democrats are willing to spend more then the R’s but not enough to make too much of a difference in working peoples lives. They are essentially Republican Lite and subscribe to the same lies about Federal Finances. Both parties deny the reality of our current fiat system. They either are ignorant, or are keeping us in the dark by design. I am sure it’s a mix of both. Our progress as a nation keeps on getting slowed and the Elite gets more powerful.

### It’s about Power and Control
The debt ceiling was created in 1917 by passage of the [Second Liberty Bond Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3110). Prior to that it was an arbitrary understanding in Congress. Up until the 1970’s the Debt Ceiling acted as a hedge on the Federal Budget executed by the President. That changed with the [Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974). This changed budgetary procedure setting it as the basis for today’s process in Congress.

The Debt Ceiling more recently has become a way for mainly Republican’s to hold the government hostage in order for some of their policy demands be met. It’s mostly a political tool, recently used by conservatives. There have been many manufactured crises because of this strategy (_1995, 2011, 2013, 2015_). None of which have any basis in macro-economic reality for a government who issues their own currency. Our Federal government can never run out of dollars, unless it chooses to. It can always pay its bills as long as they are denominated in its sovereign currency, the Dollar. The ‘debt’ is a surplus for the private sector. An expanding economy needs an expanding currency supply, or it will come to a halt. Inflation is a concern at a point in the distant future. We are in ‘debt’ $18T but inflation is between 1%—2%. People don’t have enough money to spend to keep the economy rolling, which has made them go into debt to maintain their standard of living. These debts limit our freedom and keep us under control.

This so-called common sense is keeping our economic engine idle, while expanding the gap between the rich and the rest.

__Then again, maybe that is the point__
