#### The Need for Charity is a Symptom

### The Season of Giving, or ignoring

We just came out of the Holiday season—a season of Charity if you will. Everyone is filled with the spirit of giving during that time period and charitable organizations are ever present (think The Salvation Army).  Drop some change in the bucket to help those in need and maybe feel a little better. How could this be harmful?  You get satisfaction in helping your fellow man and those in need get some help during this time period—Everyone wins.

### The Perpetuation of a Deficient System
The fact that there is a need for charity should alarm us to how deficient the economic system is here in our country.  As Dr. Martin Luther King said; <p class=”quotation“>True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.”
He pretty much sums it up, simply but so eloquently. Questioning charity, or refusing to participate in giving doesn’t really get you much praise—neither does challenging the system that forces you to consider these issues. Capitalism is good…end of story. There are poor people because they lack initiative, or are lazy, yada yada…same BS talking points. It is never a result of systemic deficiencies.

### Charity and Empathy
Our society is decreasing in
[empathy](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/09/23/facebook-and-narcissism/is-declining-empathy-technologys-fault)—for a myriad of reasons. Margaret Thatcher's famous quote sums up the attitude of Neoliberalism.

>"They are casting their problems at society. And, you know, there's no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look after themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then, also, to look after our neighbors.-Margaret Thatcher"

The focus of the ‘individual’ these last 40 or so years, have made us less aware or less willing to step in someone else’s shoes when contemplating anything about our world. The Iron Ladies quote could summarize the shift in our society’s collective thinking. I think individuals make up societies and societies provide advantages to allow the individual to flourish. I do not think these are mutually exclusive aspects of human well-being. Government sets up the structure of societies and establishes its priorities.  Our government is failing its citizens in our country to lay the foundation for as many individuals to flourish and our country as a whole.

### Charity is Big Business
One of the great things about Neo-liberal Capitalism, is that it sees business opportunities everywhere. Infrastructure, education, or health and incarceration—there is definitely money to be made. Charity is no different. It is big business receiving over 300 Billion Dollars as recent ago as 2012. Even some CEO’s of our favorite charitable organizations are raking in the
[big bucks](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Media/Slideshow/2012/12/20/10-Insanely-Overpaid-Nonprofit-Execs), making upwards of $1 million dollars.

Instead of fixing the system that creates the need for charity, we perpetuate it by having organizations depending on the guilt felt by others, plug holes created by our deficient economic system. We depend on [Charity](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/business/charitys-role-in-america-and-its-limits.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0) more then most first world countries who try to tackle this deficiencies with taxes on the wealthy and a more robust social welfare system. Most people probably say to themselves “That poor person, I’m gonna try to help them as best I can”, which is admirable. Why don’t we ask: “We are the richest nation on Earth, why do we have the need for Charity in the first place?” The best way to help all or these people is to repair the system that created them in the first place. That would be the empathetic, just and human(e) thing to do.
