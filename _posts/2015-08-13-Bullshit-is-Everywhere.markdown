####Jon Stewart’s parting thought from his final Daily Show

On August 6, 2015 Jon Stewart ended his 17-year run as the host of Daily Show. After all the hoopla and cameos—he left us with a sobering, and needed, call to arms (which is below). Thank you Jon Stewart for your insight and guidance through the sea of bullshit we are constantly bombarded with.


###Bullshit is everywhere
Bullshit is everywhere.
There is very little you will encounter in life that has not been, in some ways, infused with bullshit — not all of it bad. General day-to-day free range is often necessary, or at least innocuous: “Oh, what a beautiful baby. I’m sure he’ll grow into that head.” That kind of bullshit in many ways provides important social-contract fertilizer and keeps people from make each other cry all day. But then there’s the more pernicious bullshit, your premeditated institutional bullshit designed to obscure and distract. Designed by whom? **The Bullshitocracy.**

###It comes in three basic flavors

One, making bad things sound like good things. “Organic, all-natural cupcakes” … because factory made sugar oatmeal balls doesn’t sell. “Patriot Act” … because “Are You Scared Enough to Let Me Look at All Your Phone Records Act” doesn’t sell. Whenever something is titled—*freedom, fairness, family, health,* and *America*—take a good long sniff. Chances are it’s been manufactured in a facilitate that may contain traces of bullshit.

###Number two, the second way, hiding the bad things under mountains of bullshit
Complexity — you know, I would love to download Drizzy’s latest Meek Mill diss. (Everyone promised me that that made sense.) But I’m not really interested right now in reading Tolstoy’s iTunes agreement, so I’ll just click “agree” even if it grants Apple *prima noctae* with my spouse.
Here’s another one — simply put, banks shouldn’t be able to bet your pension money on red.
Bullshititly put, it’s — hey, this. Dodd-Frank. Hey, a handful of billionaires can’t buy our elections, right? Of course not. They can only pour unlimited anonymous cash into a 501(c)4 other wise they’d have to 501(c)6 it, or funnel it openly through a non-campaign coordinated Super PAC … “I think they’re asleep now. We can sneak out.”

And finally — finally, it’s the Bullshit of infinite possibility. These bullshitters cover their unwillingness to act under the guise of unending inquiry. We can’t do anything because we don’t yet know everything. We cannot take action on climate change until everyone in the world agrees gay marriage vaccines won’t cause our children to marry goats who are going to come for our guns. Until then, I say teach the controversy.

Now, the good news is this—bullshitters have gotten pretty lazy, and their work is easily detected. And looking for it is a pleasant way to pass the time like an “I Spy” of bullshit. I say to you tonight friends the best defense against bullshit is vigilance.
So if you *smell something*, **say something**.
