In January, a new Congress will be sworn in—elected by 15%-18% of the electorate. The 2014 midterms were the worst turnout in [72 years](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/the-worst-voter-turnout-in-72-years.html?_r=0) at 36.2%. In 43 states less than half of the eligible population voted.

### Mo Money, Mo Problems
Though over $500 million was spent this past fall—we still didn’t bother to go and vote. This made 2014 the second most expensive election in history, behind 2012’s Presidential Election. Both parties played the money game this time, but the Republican’s still had a slight advantage. The [2010 Citizen’s United](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission2010) SCOTUS decision has made a mockery of our so-called democracy. Add in the [McCutcheon v FCC]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCutcheon_v._Federal_Election_Commission) from this past spring and things aren’t looking good for ‘We the People’.

### How we Stack up
Comparatively speaking we stink with voter turnout among[OECD]( http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/topics/civic-engagement/) nations. The average being over 70%. Some countries like Australia have compulsory voting (meaning it’s the law to vote) leading to the highest percentage of 93%. I am not sure that would fly in the U.S. we seem to not like to be ‘forced’ to do anything, even if it’s for our own good.

### Low Turnout is a Symptom not a Cause
Most people are apathetic when it comes to politics in this country. They don’t really think their votes make much difference, (they may not be incorrect in that observation, see below). A powerful conservative message machine has convinced us, that government is always inefficient, take our money and gives it to those undeserving, and looks to control business with costly regulation, just because.

These same politicians—defund services that effect most people—causing them to be inefficient and not very customer friendly. Keeping us disengaged and apathetic and not trusting of government, keeps turnout low and maybe lets the Elite do whatever they want, thus creating our current unequal and apathetic society that they can benefit from. Factor these in with the new Voter id laws and repealing of aspects of the Voting Rights Act, it seems us people have to just take what they give us.

### If it looks like oligarchy, and smells like oligarchy…
An academic study was published this past fall that got a lot of attention. Martin Gilens of Princeton, and Benjamin Page of Northwestern, authored this [paper]( http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdfpaper), after researching who influenced the policy decisions of 1,779 policy issues. They come to some disturbing conclusions—although not ever labeling the U.S. an ‘oligarchy’ per se.   

“__A final point__: Even in a bivariate, descriptive sense, our evidence indicates that the responsiveness of the U.S. political system when the general public wants government action is severely limited. Because of the impediments to majority rule that were deliberately built into the U.S. political system—federalism, separation of powers, bicameralism—together with further impediments due to anti-majoritarian congressional rules and procedures, the system has a substantial status quo bias. Thus when popular majorities favor the status quo, opposing a given policy change, they are likely to get their way; but when a majority—even a very large majority—of the public favors change, it is not likely to get what it wants.” _—from Page 573_

This paper is worth your consideration for anyone concerned about the health of our Republic.  We may not be an oligarchy quite yet, but it doesn’t seem like the people are heard with regard to public policy, especially economic.
