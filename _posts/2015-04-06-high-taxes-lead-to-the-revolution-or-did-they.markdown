#### A little misunderstanding among friends
It’s April, the sun is warming, the flowers are blooming, and everyone is looking forward to receiving back their tax returns. The common narrative today as repeated over and over mostly by Conservatives, is that taxes are bad, a form of theft, too high, too complicated and an enabler of fiscal irresponsibility on the part of the federal government.

__Boo__ taxes!

__Boo__ government! ... yada yada yada.

Taxes aren’t inherently bad or state sponsored theft, they are just ”the bill for civilization” as Oliver Wendell Holmes once quipped. In this Tax season lets look at one of the most famous stories of America and taxes. The Boston Tea Party—to determine if what we were told as children, holds any water.

### Lets party like it’s 1773
The Tea Party—not to be confused with the conservative political movement starting in 2010—is the most referred to manifestation of how Americans feel about taxes, insinuating that we are opposed to them no questions asked. If you look deeper into that important event, did the founding fathers oppose taxes as some would lead you to believe? What was the context of this famous event in Boston? What led up to the boiling over of hostilities between here and England? Does the history match the supposed narrative of high taxes as the cause of the Boston Tea Party?

### Lets set the stage
There were two issues at play leading up to the Sons of Liberty peppering the harbor with casks of tea. The first, the East India Company was losing money, hundreds of thousands of £’s because of high import taxes levied on tea brought into Great Britain. Britons sought cheaper smuggled tea from Holland as tea grew more and more popular in the British Isles and colonies. The second was finding where Parliaments authority begins and ends for the American colonies. These two issues would intertwine and send our colonial brethren over the edge and closer to armed revolution.

### Smoldering outrage
The East India Company was the largest corporation in the world at the time and the British Parliament wanted to help them out (their profits were falling and the King and aristocracy were shareholders) so they passed the Tea Act in 1773, which exempted the EIC from import taxes on their tea. This tax break allowed them to significantly undercut small business sellers and smugglers in the colonies.  Parliament had already given an importation monopoly in England to the EIC in 1698. Followed by an act in 1721 restricting tea imports of the colonies to tea from England (via the EIC). Parliament created in essence, a state sponsored monopoly, undercutting their competition, colonial businesses and merchants, which included some of our founders.

### Shift of burden from Corporation to the Colonists  
In order for Parliament to make up the lost revenue from the subsidy given to the East India Company, they passed the [Townshend Revenue Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts) of 1767, levying new taxes onto the colonists on goods and services including tea. These kind of shifts of tax burden are pretty typical in [modern America](http://rdwolff.com/content/massive-shift-tax-burden-corporations-individuals-statistical-mirage), where corporate interests supersede the general populations, and common in the 18th Century too. After the passage of the Townshend Act, colonists argued that since they did not have representation in Parliament, it was a violation of the British Constitution for them to have taxes levied upon them. __“Taxation without Representation”__ became a rallying cry and relegated itself to the annals of history. Parliament then passed the [Declaratory Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act) in 1766, which extended the reach of their legislation to the colonies—thus flexing their sovereignty this side of the Atlantic.

### The Colonies were against cronyism.
The Tea Act was the last in a long line of legislation from the Crown that created unfair markets for goods here in the Colonies.  These things were done without the colonist’s approval or even airing of grievances. It’s interesting to note that the British aristocrats were doing then what the modern aristocrats are doing now. Using the power of the Government to shape policy in their interest.
