#### A question that needs to be answered

There comes a time when it is appropriate to ask yourself what sort of country do want to live in? Is it a country where everyone gets the same opportunity to succeed no matter what? Or is it a country where, your chance of success depends on to whom, and where you were born?  The United States seems to be trending more and more toward the latter (hyperlink to social mobility stats).  The Powerful in our society have been consolidating their power in a myriad of ways for the past 30 or so years—this is very unhealthy for democracy, and our nation as a whole.

The economy is the foundation for which our society has been built onto.  Our two-party political system is indebted to the huge amounts of money thrown its way to sway outcomes in their own self-interest. In the U.S. we have a right-wing party (R’s), and a center-right party (D’s). Most other advanced democracies have many different parties, representing differing political philosophies, at their disposal.

True, the D’s are way more diverse on the political spectrum than the R’s…but as the R’s have gotten more conservative so has the D’s.  The Left is all but unseen in American politics. That needs to change if we have any chance in creating a more functioning democracy and a fairer economy that works for the majority, not a wealthy few.

A thirty-year smear campaign from American Conservatives has all but silenced any dissenting left-wing voice in this country. Cries of ‘Socialism’, ‘Fascism’, ‘Communism’ and other movements attributed to Left leaning politics, have confused the public and aroused a negative irrational response to each of those terms from the majority of the public, preventing any healthy policy debate in this country.

Progressives/Liberals need to take a page out of the Conservative’s book and mount a positive PR campaign, to reclaim their good name, and awaken the American people to the chaos that has ensued in their absence. It will not be easy, or quick, but is necessary if our country is to keep on thriving into the future. Most of the country is on our side with policy and we are getting more and more Liberal, especially on social issues. They are just afraid to be associated with the Left for fear of castigation. We as Liberal/Progressives need to change this.
